- Should support argument to load an external jsonp file
- Should suggest back button when going to youtube 
- Should have hints to learn while using the map
- Should have menus to give access to extended features/links

- Optimize lazyloading. Showing last image should not load the previous images. (DONE: 680b0dd99033d67c0469086ea59b51cdef0de730)
- When map is zoomed in after centering a marker, marker should be centered again. (DONE: 196434e485f8e1560256c9e13dcac5d0015bf6a2) - undone because of side effects.
